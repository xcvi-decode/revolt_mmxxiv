          There will be differences of opinion in the family... but we will not
          be enemies to each other. We will not think of anyone as enemy because
          of his or her opinion. We will not consider anyone as enemy because of
          religion. Today, I recall with great respect all the brave martyrs who
          sacrificed their lives in the liberation war and I pray to the
          Almighty Allah for salvation of their departed souls. As a result, the
          country's victory was achieved and Bangladesh emerged as an
          independent and sovereign state.

              The civil defence agency said a dawn air strike on the home of the
              al-Ghoula family in Gaza City killed 11 people, seven of them
              children. AFP images from the Gaza City area neighbourhood of
              Shujaiya showed residents combing through smoking rubble. Bodies
              including those of small children were lined up on the ground,
              shrouded in white sheets. Late on Friday Hamas had said indirect
              negotiations with Israel were to resume in Qatar that same night
              for a truce and hostage release deal. There has since been no
              update.

              “The trajectory is just incredible,” C3S director Carlo Buontempo
              told the Reuters news agency, describing how every month in 2024
              was the warmest or second-warmest for that month since records
              began. The planet’s average temperature in 2024 was 1.6 degrees
              Celsius higher than in 1850-1900, the “pre-industrial period”
              before humans began burning CO2-emitting fossil fuels on a large
              scale, C3S added.
