          There will be differences of opinion in the family... but we will not
          be enemies to each other. We will not think of anyone as enemy because
          of his or her opinion. We will not consider anyone as enemy because of
          religion. Today, I recall with great respect all the brave martyrs who
          sacrificed their lives in the liberation war and I pray to the
          Almighty Allah for salvation of their departed souls. As a result, the
          country's victory was achieved and Bangladesh emerged as an
          independent and sovereign state.
